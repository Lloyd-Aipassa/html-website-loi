				<h2>New York City</h2>

				<p>
					New York is the largest and most
					important city in the United States of
					America. About ten million people live
					in New York and just over twenty-two
					million in the metropolitan area. This
					puts New York in the list of the ten
					largest cities in the world. In many
					ways New York is one of the most
					important cities in the world, be it in
					the field of commerce, finance, art or
					fashion; New York is 'The place to be'.
					When you walk around Manhattan you
					notice everything that you are in the
					center of the world. The energy you feel
					when you walk through Manhattan is
					unlike any other city in the world.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Manhattan is just one of the five
					boroughs that make up New York. The
					others are Brooklyn, Queens, Staten
					Island and The Bronx. The other boroughs
					are much less recognizable, but are
					therefore no less worth a visit. A visit
					to New York is an accumulation of
					highlights for most tourists.

					<p>
						Manhattan Island and other parts
						of present-day New York were
						originally inhabited by the
						Lenni-Lenape Indians. The first
						European known to have come into
						contact with these Indians was
						Giovanni da Verrazzano. A bridge
						between Brooklyn and Staten
						Island is named after this
						explorer. It would be more than
						eighty years before another
						European sailed to what is now
						New York. This was the explorer
						Henry Hudson, who discovered the
						island of Manhattan. The same
						Hudson that took the Dutch to
						present-day New York, after
						which they built a few trading
						posts. The first settlements
						were built in 1624 and New
						Amsterdam was founded a few
						years later. In 1664 this colony
						was conquered by the English
						who, thanks to the Peace of
						Westminster, finally took
						control of this area. They
						renamed the city New York in
						honor of the Duke of York. After
						the War of Independence, New
						York became the capital of the
						then formed United States in
						1788, until 1790 when
						Philadelphia received this
						honor. After this, things move
						quickly with New York, the New
						York Stock Exchange is opened in
						1792, the Commissioners' Plan is
						introduced in 1811 and Central
						Park is constructed in 1857.
						Partly due to the Great
						Migration and the many
						immigrants seeking refuge in
						America, New York, with more
						than 10 million inhabitants,
						grew into the first megacity in
						the world at the beginning of
						the twentieth century. During
						this period, the skyline of the
						city is formed. Many of the
						skyscrapers that can be found in
						New York today were built in the
						1920s and 1930s. In the rest of
						the twentieth century, the city
						experienced several peaks and
						valleys, but continued to grow
						steadily. In 2001, disaster
						struck the city when a terrorist
						attack was committed on the Twin
						Towers.

					<p>
						Billy Joel already sang about it
						in the seventies and in 2009
						Jay-Z and Alicia Keys did it
						again with 'Empire State of
						Mind'. When you walk in New York
						you feel the city, you notice
						everything that you are in a
						metropolis. The city is bustling
						and gives you energy. In that
						respect, the nickname “The City
						That Never Sleeps” certainly
						rings true. Walking through New
						York you realize at many times
						that you are in perhaps the most
						important city in the world. You
						will probably not let go of this
						feeling during a visit to New
						York. To understand what the New
						York State of Mind is, you must
						have visited New York at least
						once.

					<h2>Nicknames</h2>
					<img

						alt="img of an apple in front of new york"
					/>

					<p>
						New York has many nicknames. The
						city's most famous nickname is
						probably "The Big Apple". The
						city owes this nickname to
						reporter John Fitzgerald who
						frequently used this nickname.
						The worldwide fame of this
						nickname is due to the 'I ♥ NY'
						advertising campaign that used
						an apple during their campaign.
						Another well-known New York
						nickname is “The City That Never
						Sleeps”. This nickname owes its
						fame mainly to the movie "New
						York, New York" with the song of
						the same name sung by Frank
						Sinatra. Another well-known
						nickname is “The Empire City”,
						which is mainly used to indicate
						the size of New York.
