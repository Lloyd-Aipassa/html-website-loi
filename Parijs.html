						Paris was occupied by the
						Germans during World War II, but
						it was later liberated and
						rebuilt. The city played a key
						role in the development of
						modern art and literature, and
						it was home to many famous
						writers, artists, and
						intellectuals, such as
						Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and
						Picasso. Today, Paris is a major
						global city and a center of
						culture, fashion, and politics.
						It is home to many world-class
						museums, theaters, and other
						cultural institutions, and it is
						a popular tourist destination,
