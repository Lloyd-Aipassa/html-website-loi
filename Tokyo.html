					<p>
						The rich history of Tokyo goes
						back to nearly nine hundred
						years ago. Tokyo was then called
						Edo and was a small fishing
						village in the Musashi province.
						In the twelfth century the
						village was fortified by the Edo
						clan, who actually laid the
						foundation for the status that
						the place would later receive.
						Over the centuries, Edo grew
						little by little. When the
						Tokugawa shogunate seized power
						in Japan and made Edo its
						headquarters in 1603, the place
						grew rapidly. Already in the
						year 1721 the limit of 1 million
						inhabitants was reached. Edo had
						become the largest city in Japan
						and one of the largest
						metropolises in the world. In
						its existence, Edo was
						frequently affected by disasters
						and misfortunes. Great fires,
						earthquakes, epidemics and wars
						have regularly hit the city for
						three and a half centuries. For
						example, during the Edo period
						(1603 to 1868) alone, nearly a
						hundred natural fires started
						that period. The most
						destructive fire was the Great
						Fire of Meireki, which killed
						more than 100,000 people in a
						blaze that lasted for over three
						days. In 1868 the Tokugawa
						period came to an end and the
						Meiji Restoration followed. This
						marked the end of the shoguns
						and the beginning of the city of
						Tokyo. The core task of the new
						leaders was to modernize Japan.

					<h2>Tokyo state of mind</h2>

					/>
					<p>
						If you try to capture the
						essence of Tokyo's state of mind
						that would be a real challenge.
						Tokyo is a city full of energy
						and activity. It is also a
						fast-paced place, where the
						people always seems to be in a
						hurry to get somewhere or do
						something new. And yet, despite
						all this activity, there's a
						feeling that everything is
						happening for a reason. The
						thing that makes Tokyo special
						really special are the people
						who live there. They're known
						for their incredible work ethic,
						their deep sense of community,
						and their unfailing politeness
						and hospitality. Living in a
						city of millions is just
						creating a strong sense of
						connection and belonging that
						brings people together. Of
						course, Tokyo is also a city
						that's always looking forward.
						Whether it's through
						cutting-edge technology,
						groundbreaking architecture, or
						innovative new businesses,
						there's always something new and
						exciting happening in Tokyo.
